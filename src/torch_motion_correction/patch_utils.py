    Attributes
    ----------
    image : torch.Tensor
        The input image (movie frame stack) to draw patches from with shape
        (t, H, W) where t is the number of frames, H is height and W is width.
    image_shape : tuple[int, int, int]
        Shape of the input image (t, H, W).
    patch_size : tuple[int, int]
        Size of the patches to extract (ph, pw) in terms of pixels.
    control_points : torch.Tensor
        Control points in pixel coordinates with shape (t, gh, gw, 3) where
        gh and gw are the number of control points in height and width dimensions,
        and 3 corresponds to (time, y, x) coordinates.
    control_points_normalized : torch.Tensor
        Control points normalized to [0, 1] in all dimensions with shape

    Methods

    get_iterator(
        batch_size: int, randomized: bool = True
    ) -> Iterator[tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]]
        Data-loader style iterator yielding batches of image patches and corresponding
        normalized control points for each batch.
